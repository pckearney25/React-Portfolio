# React-Portfolio
New portolio page made using React and CSS Flexbox.

Overview:
The application was designed to highlight my coding portfolio. This single page application contains views for Home, About Me, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact pages. The Contact page is coded as per specifications for deployment to the Go-Daddy PHP mail server.

This apllication is an updated version of the Portfolio page I coded in May.  Much of the styling is the same, but the scroll feature of that app has been abandoned for the use of the React Router component. For an added "wow" I included a Home page that displays a timed sequence of statements against a black background which then fades to reveal the background picture for the app.  The app also includes verticle timelines, and dynamically generated routes to the blog pages. 

Authors
The React-Portfolio presented here was coded by Patrick Kearney.
